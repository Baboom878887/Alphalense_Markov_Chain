    "# Factor Investing Research In QuantConnect\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this Notebook is to implement in QuantConnect most of the features present in Alphalens (Quantopian): a set of standard statistical techniques commonly used in the research process of factor selection for the design of long-short equity strategies.\n",
    "Most of the analysis is carried out visually through a number of plots with the intention to speed up the process of iterating and testing different factors. However, the tools below also return all the necessary data for the user to extend this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook is structured in two sections: Factor Analysis and Risk Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Using Factors To Construct A Long-Short Equity Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This section corresponds to the **FactorAnalysis class** whose purpose is to build a long-short portfolio based on statistically significant factors.\n",
    "* Provided a list of tickers and time period, this class will pull at initialization all the **historical OHLCV** data needed for analysis.\n",
    "* Using the CustomFactor function, **calculate factor values for each symbol and time** based on historical price and volume data. This function gets applied to the historical OHLCV DataFrame for each symbol, and the calculations need to be done in a rolling fashion so each day gets a factor value based on data up until that point (see examples of factors below for more info). These factors can then be **standardized and used to create combined factors** as linear combinations of single factors.\n",
    "* The next step in the process is to **create quantile groups** based on the chosen factors and calculate different **forward period returns** to assess the relationship between the two.\n",
    "* Finally, we need to **build a portfolio** that goes long one quintile and short another with the idea of potentially exploiting the returns spread between two opposite quantiles. Naturally, this can only be done successfully if the factors are able to consistently separate relative winners from losers.\n",
    "* A standard way of assessing the degree of **correlation between the factors and forward returns** is the Spearman Rank Correlation (Information Coefficient). This measure will also be plotted for each forward return period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Analysing Common Risk Exposures Of The Long-Short Equity Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "This section corresponds to the **RiskAnalysis class** whose purpose is to discover what **risk factors our strategy is exposed to and to what degree**. As we will see below in more detail, these external factors can be any time series of returns that our portfolio could have some exposure to. Some popular risk factors are provided here (Fama-French Five Factors, Industry Factors), but the user can easily test any other by passing its time series of returns.\n",
    "* Run **multiple linear regression** for the entire period of analysis along with **partial regression** plots for each pair of dependent/independent variables.\n",
    "* Run **rolling multiple regression** and visualize the **rolling coefficients** for each independent variable throughout the entire period. Ideally, the exposures remain relatively stable throughout time.\n",
    "* Visualize the **distribution of rolling exposures** in order to quickly see where the average exposures lie and their range.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements a Hidden Markov Model to discover hidden market regimes (states) in Apple (AAPL) stock and generate trading signals based on state predictions. The HMM identifies latent market conditions that are not directly observable but influence price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Hidden States**: Unobservable market regimes (Bull, Bear, Sideways) that drive observable features\n",
    "- **Observations**: Observable features like returns, volatility, momentum, volume, and price ranges\n",
    "- **Transition Matrix**: Probabilities of moving between states\n",
    "- **Emission Probabilities**: How features are distributed in each state\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Configuration:\n",
    "- **N_STATES = 3**: Three hidden states optimal for 10-15 day predictions (Bull/Bear/Sideways)\n",
    "- **COVARIANCE_TYPE = 'diag'**: Diagonal covariance acts as regularization with limited data\n",
    "- **N_ITER = 100**: EM algorithm iterations for parameter optimization\n",
    "- **RANDOM_STATE = 42**: For reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization Guidelines:\n",
    "1. **Avoid Overfitting**: Use diagonal covariance, cross-validation, and BIC for model selection\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: Choose uncorrelated features that capture different market aspects\n",
    "3. **Walk-Forward Validation**: Train on expanding windows, test on out-of-sample data\n",
    "4. **Regularization**: StandardScaler normalization + diagonal covariance\n",
    "5. **State Count**: Use BIC to find optimal number of states (typically 2-4 for daily data)"

    "- Successfully implemented a 3-state HMM for AAPL stock analysis\n",
    "- Used diagonal covariance for regularization\n",
    "- Achieved model convergence in training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings**:\n",
    "1. **Hidden States**: The model identifies distinct market regimes with different return/volatility characteristics\n",
    "2. **State Persistence**: Transition matrix reveals how long states typically persist\n",
    "3. **Predictive Power**: States provide actionable signals for 10-15 day predictions\n",
    "4. **Out-of-Sample Performance**: Test set results validate the model's generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for Production Use**:\n",
    "1. **Retrain Periodically**: Use walk-forward validation approach, retrain every 20-60 days\n",
    "2. **Monitor State Stability**: Track if state characteristics remain consistent\n",
    "3. **Combine with Other Signals**: HMM states work well as regime filters for other strategies\n",
    "4. **Risk Management**: Use state volatility estimates for position sizing\n",
    "5. **Feature Selection**: Regularly validate that chosen features remain predictive\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Checklist**:\n",
    "- \u2713 Vectorized operations (no loops)\n",
    "- \u2713 StandardScaler normalization\n",
    "- \u2713 Diagonal covariance (regularization)\n",
    "- \u2713 70/30 train/test split\n",
    "- \u2713 Walk-forward validation\n",
    "- \u2713 BIC-based model selection\n",
    "- \u2713 Out-of-sample testing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps**:\n",
    "- Test on other tickers for robustness\n",
    "- Experiment with different feature combinations\n",
    "- Implement regime-dependent position sizing\n",
    "- Add transaction costs to performance evaluation"
